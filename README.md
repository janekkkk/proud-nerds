# Proud Nerds

A modern web application project utilizing **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and various development tools for a seamless development experience. This project is set up for frontend development with linting, type-checking, and testing support.

It's made to test my development skills while interviewing for Proud Nerds.
